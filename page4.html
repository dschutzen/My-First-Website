    <p>
        Below is a more complete description of the above images. All of the above images can be enlarged
        by clicking on the image.

            <li>
                <span class="img-description">Antenna Rotator.</span>
                <span class="ol-li_text">
                    The first image above is a RCA antenna rotator.  It comes with a control box which
                    and remote control.  The control box has 12 presets for automatic antenna positioning.
                    You can use the contol box to rotate the antenna 360 degrees. Once you find a sweet
                    spot for a particular station. You can set 1 of the 12 presets to that position.
                    This makes repositioning the antenna to optimize reception for a particular station
                    an ease.

                <span class="img-description">Antenna Amplifier.</span>

                <span class="ol-li_text">
                    The antenna amplifier comes with a power source and amplifier.  The actual amplifier is
                    mounted as close to the antenna as possible.  The idea is to amplify the signal before it
                    experiences losses in a long cable. The amplitude of the signal will be attenuated as it
                    runs through the cable, but the noise level will not. If the signal is well above the noise
                    level at the source (the antenna), then mounting the amplifier close to the source helps
                    keep your signal above the noise level as it travels through the cable.  The power supply
                    is used indoors and is connected to an interface that provides power to the amplifier on
                    one side, while the other side passes the signal to the TV.

                <span class="img-description">Typical Smart TV screen.</span>
                <span class="ol-li_text">
                    This picture shows the Home screen for the typical smart TV. The right portion of the
                    screen displays 3 columns of steaming channels. Which streaming channels are displayed
                    will vary depending on each individuals selection of channels to view. If you enlarge
                    this image (just click on the image above, labeled C), you will notice the first row
                    contains "DVD player" and "Live TV".  This is the difference between a Smart TV and
                    a regular TV with an external device.  Everything is selected through the Roku Home
                    Menu including "Live TV" (antenna <abbr title="Over the air">OTA</abbr> broadcasts) and
                    any external device that is connected. The Roku remote that comes with the TV, controls
                    everything including scrolling between channels after selecting "Live TV".

            <li>
                <span class="img-description">TV menu for changing input.</span>
                <span class="ol-li_text">
                    Most conventional TVs require you to select external devices from an Input Selection
                    menu that is displayed after pressing the "input" button on the remote. I call it the
                    "input" button because that is what it is called on <strong>my</strong> remote control,
                    but it may vary, depending on the brand of the TV and/or remote. Again, you can enlarge
                    the picture labeled 'D' above and get a better idea of what I am talking about. On my
                    particular TV, the names for the input are rather limited and I chose "PVR" as the name
                    for the external Roku device which is connected to input nuber 6.

            <li>
                <span class="img-description">Roku Screen after switching TV input.</span>
                <span class="ol-li_text">
                    After selecting "[6] PVR" from the Input Selection menu (previously described), the
                    Roku menu shown in this picture is displayed.  If I want to switch back to antenna TV,
                    I just need to select "[1] TV".  The Input Selection menu will automatically go away
                    after a few seconds.

                <span class="ol-li_text">
                    This final picture shows the Roku Home menu displayed on a conventional TV after the
                    Input Selection menu dissapears.  Compare this image to the image in 'C' to see the
                    difference between a Smart TV and a conventional TV.  Note on a Smart TV, only one remote
                    control is needed to control the streaming and the <abbr title="Over the air">OTA</abbr>
                    broadcasts ("live TV").
